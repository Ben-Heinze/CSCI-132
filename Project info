Political RiffRaff is a program that reads an input file and scans it for 3 numbers.
the first number is how many nodes to create (number of candidates)
The two other numbers represent iteraters that cycle through the doubly circular linked list and land on specific candidates. 
One moves clockwise and the other rotates counter clockwise.

Once the two iteraters land on the same candidate, that candidate is declared the winner.

Evertime the iteraters land on a number, that number is removed from the linked list until there are no candidates left.
